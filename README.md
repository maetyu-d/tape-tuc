Tape TUC enables a selected audio file to be chopped up and each section to play back at a different speed (forwards or reverse). A unique feature is that the overall playback time can be adjusted independently, and the speed relationships between all segments will be preserved. Several tape-like behaviours can also be switched on and off.

Requires Python 3.12.xx and:

PyQt6
pyqtgraph
numpy
soundfile
